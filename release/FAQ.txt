Q: What is JoySens?
A: JoySens is a custom firmware plugin for Sony PSP that allows you to control the sensitivity of the analog stick in a very
   efficient way as well as "repair" faulty analog sticks. In very bad cases where the analog stick is not repairable, you
   can also just disable it so it doesn't interfere with your games anymore.
   Apart from that it includes functionality to swap and remap DPad input to analog stick and vice versa, hence allows you
   to control the XMB with the analog stick for example.


Q: How do I set JoySens to be able to control the XMB with the analog?
A: Make sure that forceanalog is set to 1 in the ini (default) and change the remap mode in the [VSH] section to Analog->DPad (2)
   or Analog<->DPad (3) if you still want to be able to give analog input in some way (for the photo viewer or browser).


Q: My analog stick is messed up and lets my characters move in random directions even when I don't touch it!
A: When the direction tends to always be the same, it's very likely that your analog stick is just off-centered.
   You have two options to fix this illbehaviour, a semi-automatic and a manual method.
   For the semi-automatic method, see the readme under "CENTER" for exact instructions on that.
   
   For the manual method you need to adjust the center value in the ini to match your analog stick. You'll find good values for
   it by leaving the analog stick untouched and watching the first pair of values in the first line of the info output.
   Try to find a good average of the values you see and put those in the ini file. Restart your PSP and check if the second
   pair of values in the first line of the info output stay at <0,0> when the analog stick is untouched and repeat the steps
   from above if it doesn't.

   If the directions are completely random and never go in the same direction, it's probably just that the analog stick is
   too responsive. In that case, try setting the adjust parameter to something like 2.0 - 2.5. Then slowly increase the value
   until the ghost movement is gone.

Q: My analog stick doesn't recognize input to the left/right/top/bottom!
A: This is caused by the analog stick returning too small values, even when pushed to the extremes at which it should give
   either -128 (up and left direction) or 127 (down and right direction). This can be solved by "rescaling" the values into
   the proper range, either with a semi-automatic method or a manual method.
   
   For the semi-automatic method, see the readme under "RESCALE" or read http://www.fx-world.org/wordpress/?page_id=65 point 2.
   
   For the manual method, check the first line of the info output when pressing the analog stick in that direction. If the analog stick scales correctly
   you should see values -128 (up or left) or 127 (down or right) as the first (left or right) or second (up or down) coordinate.
   So if you move your stick to the left, you should see <-128,*>, to the right you should see <127,*>, pulling up you should see
   <*,-128> and down you should see <*,127>. If the values are smaller (bigger) your analog stick is messed up and you need to adjust
   the min/max values in the ini file to represent the minimal/maximal values you get when moving the stick to the extremes.
   Let's say you get values <-128,-101> to <96,127> then edit the ini file and set min to <-128,-98> and max to <93,127> or equal.
   You should decrease the non maximum values a bit (by 2-3 is good in most cases) since those values are not 100% correct, so
   you might still end up with unresponsive input with the exact values.
   Now restart the plugin (by starting a homebrew/game or restarting the PSP) and check if analog stick is responsive again. If not
   try to decrease the values further until it is.

Q: I want joysens to only apply to game xy/vsh, what can I do?
A: While in the game of question (or VSH=XMB=PSP Firmware GUI), press NOTE+CIRCLE to save the current settings. This will
   create a new section ("[%GAMEID%]") in the joysens.ini file, with the current selected settings. Afterwards, you can edit
   the settings for this game in the joysens.ini file, or just change settings through the button combinations and press
   NOTE+CIRCLE again inside the game.
   If the save settings method doesn't work for you, or you're bound to the lite version, you have to find out the GAMEID
   and create the section for the config in the joysens.ini file yourself. You can find the GAMEID in the gamesaves folder
   matching your game (ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/), which follows the naming scheme "ULUSxxxxx", "ULESxxxxx", "ULJSxxxxx" etc.
   In the joysens.ini file, just write "[ULUS-xxxxx]" and alike at the end of the file, followed by the settings for that game
   you want to set.


Q: There are two files, joysens.prx and joysens_lite.prx. Which one is the right?
A: Normally you should only use joysens.prx (normal version). However, there might be cases in which you will want to switch to
   joysens_lite.prx (lite version).
   This could be that the normal version doesn't work for you in certain games, or together with your favorite plugins. Or maybe
   you just feel that the normal version slows your games down too much.
   The lite version might help you in those cases, however, you will have no way to change the settings ingame with button presses
   or see the info output to check how joysens is configured and how it alters your analog stick return values.
   Only the remap mode button combination will still work.
   This will probably be no problem for you, once you've setup joysens to your likings and don't depend on those features anymore.
   

Q: My analog stick is unuseable, no matter what settings I try. How do I go about disabling it?
A: Set the adjust parameter to 0 and the analog stick gets disabled.


Q: How do I go about disabling a config button? Removing the line in joysens.ini doesn't work!
A: JoySens currently handles non-existing values in the joysens.ini file as if they were set to default.
   This is to make sure that JoySens works reliable, even if the joysens.ini file got corrupt or doesn't exist any more.
   To disable a config button, you have to explicitly set it to nothing (f.e. "resetbtn = " if you want to disable the reset feature).
   If you disable the primarybtn, the config buttons will be disabled alltogether.
   
   
Q: JoySens doesn't work in CFW x.xx (>3.80)!
A: Try formating your flash1 in the recovery menu (reboot while holding R trigger). If it still won't work,
   also try formating your memory stick from the settings menu (make a backup first).
   If it still won't work, you can contact me with information on the firmware you use and I'll take a look.
